    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the properties of solar system bodies in the DP0.3 dataset by using the science example of constructing and exploring their phase curves. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DP0.3 catalogs contain both real and simulated Solar System objects (including asteroids, near-Earth objects, Trojans, trans-Neptunian objects, comets). In the real survey, these objects will change position between each Rubin image. The DP0.3 catalogs simulate the measurements of object movements between images, and these can be used to estimate their intrinsic properties and orbital parameters. An important way to characterize intrinsic properties of a solar system object is by measuring its \"phase curve\", which is the object brightness as a function of its \"solar phase angle\" (the angle made between the line of sight from the object to the Sun, and the line of sight from the object to Earth; see diagram at <a href=\"http://astronotes.co.uk/blog/2018/05/28/determining-the-h-g-parameters-of-atlas-asteroid-phase-curves.html\">David Young's webpage.</a>)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reveal the intrinsic properties of the asteroid (such as its surface properties and albedo; and as a result help determine its class of solar system body) we first must turn apparent magnitudes as a function of time (what is measured by LSST data) into \"reduced magnitude\", which takes into account the relative distances between the asteroid and the Sun/Earth (heliocentric/topocentric distances) at each observation. Reduced magnitude is normalized such that it is the brightness of an asteroid as if it is observed at 1 astronomical unit (au) from both the Sun and the Earth. Note that rotation curves or complex geometry of solar system objects are not included in DP0.3 simulations. Thus, any changes over time in an object’s apparent magnitude are due only to changes in its distance and phase angle. Phase curves can be constructed for each filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling the phase curve (reduced magnitude $H(α)$ as a function of phase angle $α$) enables measurement of the absolute magnitude, $H$, defined as the brightness at 0 phase angle. The functional form can depend on the data quality and type of object targeted. In this tutorial, we will mention three functional forms that are relevant for understanding the DP0.3 data products. These are the `HG_model`, `HG1G2_model`, and `HG12_model`. The `HG_model` is the simplest model, and has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(α)=H−2.5log_{10}[(1−G)Φ_1(α)+GΦ_2(α)],$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Φ_n$ are basis functions (which allow for one to model non-linearity in the data, but maintain linearity in the fitted parameters). $Φ_n$ are normalized to unity at α=0 deg. This model provides a best fit for the slope parameter $G$ (from which surface properties can then be derived) and the absolute magnitude $H$. $H$(α) is the reduced magnitude at a given phase angle α if measured at 1 au away from both Earth and from the Sun (i.e. unit topocentric and heliocentric distance). The `HG_model` $G$ and $H$ values are stored in the `dp03_catalogs_10yr.MPCORB` table. For further info on the `HG_model`, see [Bowell et al. 1989](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989aste.conf..524B/abstract). \n",
    "\n",
    "To better accommodate various observational effects (e.g., photometric quality, incomplete phase angle sampling) the more sophisticated `HG1G2_model` (a linear three-parameter function) and its nonlinear two-parameter version `HG12_model` were developed (see [Muinonen et al. 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Icar..209..542M/abstract)). The `HG1G2_model` has the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(α)=H−2.5log_{10}[G_1Φ_1(α)+G_2Φ_2(α) + (1-G_1-G_2)Φ_3(α)],$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which now has three free parameters, $H$, $G_1$ and $G_2$. However, a third representation, the `HG12_model`, is generally very effective for deriving reliable values of absolute magnitude when the phase angle sampling is not optimal (e.g., poor phase angle coverage at a range of phase angle). Thus, the LSST data products will compute estimated parameters of the `HG12_model` and this will be the focus of this tutorial. The `HG12_model` expresses the $G_1$ and $G_2$ parameters as a piecewise linear function of a single parameter, $G_{12}$, \n",
    "\n",
    "for $G_{12}$ > 0.2\n",
    "$$G_1 = 0.9529\\times G_{12} + 0.02162$$\n",
    "$$G_2 = -0.6125\\times G_{12} + 0.5572$$\n",
    "for $G_{12}$ < 0.2\n",
    "$$G_1 = 0.7527\\times G_{12} + 0.06164$$\n",
    "$$G_2 = -0.9612\\times G_{12} + 0.6270$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will demonstrate how to plot the phase curve of solar system bodies using the DP0.3 simulated catalogs. In Section 2 we will plot and compare the phase curves for three different types of objects at different orbital radii from the Sun, and compare the data to the LSST pipeline measured phase curve parameters, H, and G12. In Section 3, we will aggregate the phase curve fits for a number of solar system bodies in DP0.3 and study how the quality of the fit depends on LSST observations (which additionally provides some insight into expectations for real LSST data)."

    "Following the previous DP0.3 tutorial notebook 02 on the Main Belt Asteroids and notebook 03 on Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), in this Section we show an example of how to plot an observed phase curve for a few types of solar system bodies in the DP0.3 dataset. Then, we will plot the best-fit phase curve model (defined in Section 1.2) that is generated by the LSST pipeline and stored in the SSObject table. To identify our Main Belt sample, we first calculate the semi-major axis (`a`) of each object's orbit. We then select several classes of object, based on their semi-major axes: Main Belt asteroids (2.0 < `a` < 3.25 au); Jupiter Trojans (JT; 5 < `a` < 7 au), and finally Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNO) which are at `a` > 30 au. We further limit our sample to the asteroids with `numbObs` > 2000, to focus on objects with many individual observations to define its phase curve (for more information on empirical properties that influence phase curve fitting, see Section 3 and the followup tutorial notebook 04b).

    "Notice that the the phase coverage of objects at different semi-major axes are dramatically different over the 10-years of LSST. The most distant (>30 au) TNO will cover at most ~0-3 degrees in phase, while asteroids in the main belt will typically achieve between 0-30 degrees in terms of phase coverage. None of the \"good\" TNOs that we selected (even with thousands of observations) have more than 5 degrees of phase coverage. The LSST pipeline will only attempt to fit phase curves to things with more than 5 degrees of phase coverage, so the SSObject table does not include `H`, `G12` parameters for TNOs. Thus, TNOs do not have any models over-plotted. In these cases, it could be useful to independently model the phase curve using user-defined functions (e.g. for TNOs, a linear fit can be sufficient). We will explore how to explicitly model phase curves in the follow-up notebook on this topic, 04b."

Remember that the input (truth) `G` value using the `HG_model` that was used to generate the DP0.3 simulated object's observed properties was fixed across the population to a constant value of G=0.15. The DP0.3 automated phase curve fitting (which uses `HG12_model`) produces a nearly constant value for `G12` with a relatively small spread at bright magnitudes, and the scatter in measured `G12` starts to deviate more substantially at fainter magnitudes where its likely harder to recover the intrinsic value."

    "\n",
    "The above plots compare `numObs` (total in all bands) with model fits (per band) which may not be the ideal metric since the quality of phase curves can vary quite a bit between filters. Instead, we can look at the number of datapoints included in the phase curve modeling on a per filter basis (i.e. rNdata for the r-band in the `SSObject` table). Below, we look at the distribution of the number of observations in each filter used to model the phase curve per filter. One can see that generally, $r$- and $i$-bands produce the most data points for recovering phase curves, while $g$-band produces less and $z$-band produces the fewest. Phase curves measured in $r$- and $i$-bands will thus be better sampled. \n",
