    "\n",
    "This tutorial, together with tutorial `08a_Interactive_Image_Visualization` introduces three open-source Python libraries that enable powerful interactive visualization of images and catalogs.\n",
    " 1. [**HoloViews**](http://holoviews.org): Produce high-quality interactive visualizations easily by annotating plots and images rather than using direct calls to a plotting library\n",
    " 2. [**Bokeh**](https://bokeh.org): A powerful data visualization library that provides interactive tools including brushing and linking between multiple plots. `Holoviews` + `Bokeh`\n",
    " 3. [**Datashader**](https://datashader.org): Accurately render very large datasets quickly and flexibly.\n",
    " \n",
    "These packages are part of the [PyViz](http://pyviz.org/) ecosystem of tools intended for visualization in a web browser and can be used to create quite sophisticated dashboard-like interactive displays and widgets. The goal of this tutorial is to provide an introduction and starting point from which to create more advanced, custom interactive visualizations. "

    "### Logistics\n",
    "This notebook is intended to be runnable on `data.lsst.cloud`. Note that occasionally the notebook may seem to stall, or the interactive features may seem disabled. If this happens, usually a restart of the kernel fixes the issue. You might also need to log out of the RSP and start a \"large\" instance of the JupyterLab environment. In some examples shown in this notebook, the order in which the cells are run is important for understanding the interactive features, so you may want to re-run the set of cells in a given section if you encounter unexpected behavior. Note that some of the examples require manual selection of points on a graph to run correctly."

    "\n",
    "A very useful feature of `Bokeh` is the ability to add connected interactivity between plots that show different atttributes of the same data. This is called `linking`. With linked plots, we can carry out data `brushing`, whereby we select and maniplulate data synchronously across multiple linked plots. For example, if we link a skyplot with a colour-magnitude diagram of the same dataset, we can interactively explore the relationship between the positions of objects in each plot.  \n",

We will create a CDS from the data returned by the query above and pass it directly to bokeh. The CDS is the core of bokeh plots. Bokeh automatically creates a CDS from data passed as python lists or numpy arrays.

Zoom in all the way and you can see individual points (i.e., bins contain either zero or one count).
